            <main>
                <p>After the World War II, antibiotics were considered as "wonder drugs", since they were an easy remedy for
                    what had been intractable ailments. To learn which drug worked most effectively for which bacterial infection,
                    performance of the three most popular antibiotics on 16 bacteria were gathered.</p>
                <p>The values in the dataset represent the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), a measure of the effectiveness
                    of the antibiotic, which represents the concentration of antibiotic required to prevent growth in vitro.
                    The reaction of the bacteria to Gram staining is described by the covariate “gram staining”. Bacteria
                    that are stained dark blue or violet are Gram-positive. Otherwise, they are Gram-negative.</p>
                <h2>Visualization #1</h2>
                <p>Which antibiotic is the most effective (has the lowest MIC) in preventing growth in vitro for differing bacterial
                    infections?</p>
                <div id="firstViz"></div>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>The dataset has an abundant data points that varied in range and sign, however, in order to capture a
                        great multitude of data points, I’ve decided to utilize a dot plot for graphical encoding. The main
                        visual decoding task, in term of amplifying understanding of the data, for this graph is comparing
                        the value of Log MIC for each bacteria between the differing antibiotics.</p>
                    <p>The most accurate elementary perceptual task is position along a common scale. A dot graph does a great
                        job at easing the task of comparing values. Readers can easily distinguish if differing antibiotics
                        have the same Log MIC by looking checking whether the dots are overlapping one another. In addition,
                        the differing color of the dots give a good contrast, which helps reader easily distinguish which
                        dot is of higher or lower value. </p>
                    <p>I’ve decided to connect the lines between each dot in order to give users a better sense of separation
                        between each bacteria. If the dots are not connected, readers will have a harder time comparing the
                        high and low Log MIC value of antibiotics for each bacteria at a quick glance. Also, to my defense,
                        the line does not add or introduce any out-of-scope data, because the value on the x axis is nominal.
                        Hence, reader cannot make assumption or establish a non-introduced trend from looking at the lines.</p>
                </div>
                <h2>Visualization #2</h2>
                <p>Which antibiotic is more effective (has the lowest MIC) on gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria?</p>
                <div id="secondViz"></div>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>The main visual decoding task for this graph is comparing the distributing of value for antibiotics in
                        gram-positive and in gram-negative bacteria; a box plot is a great graphical encoding tool to do
                        so. A box plot utilizes the most accurate elementary perceptual task, which is comparing the position
                        along the common scale. Readers can easily distinguish the difference of low, high, median, and IQR
                        for each antibiotic. Because each antibiotics aligns next to one another, it enhances the accuracy
                        of comparing the value and also gives readers a greater understanding of the antibiotic’s effective
                        on differing type of gram staining.</p>
                    <p>The design also keeps readers’ attention focus on one demographic of the data set. By providing a large
                        difference in spacing for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, readers unconsciously comparing
                        only the values in each gram stain. The sense of separation helps making the data more digestible.
                        I also did not fully fill in the marker of the box, because I’d like provide readers the ability
                        to see the graph value line as a mean to comparing the difference in position between antibiotics
                        data point. In addition, I keep the color consistency of the antibiotics between the dot plot and
                        this graph; this ensures that readers would not need to learn additional information on the data.</p>
                </div>
                <h2>Visualization #3</h2>
                <p>On average, how do antibiotics perform on differing gram stain bacteria (gram-positive and gram-negative)?</p>
                <div id="thirdViz"></div>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>The main visual decoding task for this bar graph is comparing the average Log MIC between gram-positive
                        and gram-negative bacteria between differing antibiotics. Luckily, the visual decoding task can easily
                        be graphical encoded using the most accurate elementary perceptual task: position along a common
                        scale. A grouped bar graph allows reader to easily comparing values between one another. Therefore,
                        to compare average Log MIC between gram-positive and gram-negative, readers can simply compare how
                        each bar stands, taller or shorter, next to one another.</p>
                    <p>In addition, since the main visual decoding task consists of only comparing gram-positive to gram-negative,
                        the graph;s design has the advantage in accomplishing the elementary perceptual task of comparing
                        position along a common scale. Because there are only two bars for each antibiotic, the bars are
                        guaranteed to stand next to each other. This enhances the ability for readers to comparing the difference
                        regardless of the threshold of difference; whether the threshold of difference is high or low, the
                        fact that it stands next to each other, it increases the accuracy of distinguishing the position
                        of each value on the graph.</p>
